abstract="Kristof has derived a theorem on the maximum and minimum of the trace of matrix products of the form                                                                          {\$}{\$}X{\_}1 {\backslash}hat {\backslash}Gamma {\_}1 X{\_}2 {\backslash}hat {\backslash}Gamma {\_}2  {\backslash}cdots X{\_}n {\backslash}hat {\backslash}Gamma {\_}n{\$}{\$}                 where the matrices                                                                          {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hat {\backslash}Gamma {\_}i{\$}{\$}                 are diagonal and fixed and theX                  i                 vary unrestrictedly and independently over the set of orthonormal matrices. The theorem is a useful tool in deriving maxima and minima of matrix trace functions subject to orthogonality constraints. The present paper contains a generalization of Kristof's theorem to the case where theX                  i                 are merely required to be submatrices of orthonormal matrices and to have a specified maximum rank. The generalized theorem contains the Schwarz inequality as a special case. Various examples from the psychometric literature, illustrating the practical use of the generalized theorem, are discussed.",

title="The rigid orthogonal Procrustes rotation problem",

volume="71",
number="1",
pages="201--205",
abstract="The problem of rotating a matrix orthogonally to a best least squares fit with another matrix of the same order has a closed-form solution based on a singular value decomposition. The optimal rotation matrix is not necessarily rigid, but may also involve a reflection. In some applications, only rigid rotations are permitted. Gower (1976) has proposed a method for suppressing reflections in cases where that is necessary. This paper proves that Gower's solution does indeed give the best least squares fit over rigid rotation when the unconstrained solution is not rigid. Also, special cases that have multiple solutions are discussed.",
