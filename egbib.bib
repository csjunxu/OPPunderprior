abstract="Kristof has derived a theorem on the maximum and minimum of the trace of matrix products of the form                                                                          {\$}{\$}X{\_}1 {\backslash}hat {\backslash}Gamma {\_}1 X{\_}2 {\backslash}hat {\backslash}Gamma {\_}2  {\backslash}cdots X{\_}n {\backslash}hat {\backslash}Gamma {\_}n{\$}{\$}                 where the matrices                                                                          {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hat {\backslash}Gamma {\_}i{\$}{\$}                 are diagonal and fixed and theX                  i                 vary unrestrictedly and independently over the set of orthonormal matrices. The theorem is a useful tool in deriving maxima and minima of matrix trace functions subject to orthogonality constraints. The present paper contains a generalization of Kristof's theorem to the case where theX                  i                 are merely required to be submatrices of orthonormal matrices and to have a specified maximum rank. The generalized theorem contains the Schwarz inequality as a special case. Various examples from the psychometric literature, illustrating the practical use of the generalized theorem, are discussed.",
